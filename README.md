One of the best and important decisions that you will make after learning JavaScript, and building some projects, is to learn Typescript, because it will really help you a lot in your work, and especially in 2022, but before jumping on Typescript, you must have at least the basics of JavaScript.

## What is TypeScript?

The definition of Typescript from the [official website](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) is:
"
TypeScript is a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, giving you better tooling at any scale.
